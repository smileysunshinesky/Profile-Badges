# 🛡️ Profile Badges

This respository includes a collection of every single badge on GitHub, and how to obtain each one of them. Most of them are very easy to obtain, however, some are more difficult. This respository orders badges from `Very Easy` to `Easy` to `Medium` and finally `Hard`.

GitHub Badges were added  after the launch of the first Mars Helicopter, [Ingenuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)).

> Now today, there are a total of 11 badges on GitHub, and some with a bronze, silver, and gold tierlist too.
